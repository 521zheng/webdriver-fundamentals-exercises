================================================

Lab exercises for the [Parleys Automated Web Testing with Webdriver](https://parleys.com/course/54687f2de4b0926f4d452598) course.

This course will get you up and running with Selenium WebDriver, going from fundamental principles to more advanced automation techniques, and always with an emphasis on how to write your tests in a clean, maintainable manner that will be easy to understand and easy to change in the future. 

The course covers:
- Fundamental principles of automated web testing
- The Selenium architecture
- How (and when) to use Selenium IDE for record/replay style web test automation
- WebDriver fundamentals
- Identifying elements using CSS, XPath
- Working with HTML forms
- Working with AJAX and asynchronous page elements
- Using the Page Objects pattern
- Structuring and reporting on your test results with the Serenity library
- Setting up a Selenium Server Grid

These are fundamental principles that are important to master for any serious web tester. Even if you are already familiar the basics of WebDriver, you will benefit from the later modules where we cover more advanced techniques, and learn how to use Serenity for easier web testing and better reporting.
